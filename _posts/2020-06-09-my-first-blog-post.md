Hey! Welcome to the page! Today I am going to conduct an interview with Ricardo Gomez, a star basketball player from my school.
We have been close friends for a while and he has a really inspirational and motivational story that a lot of people can connect to or be inspired by.
hopefully Ill get some sleep to function but we will see! Peace out, and stay casual.
